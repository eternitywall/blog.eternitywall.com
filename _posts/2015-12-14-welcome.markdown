This is the first post of the official Eternity Wall blog.

We are gonna use this channel mainly for:

* `not-strictly-eternal` `longer-than-72-characters` important communication.
* Mentioning Eternity Wall messages that use the wall in interesting way.
* New sites that use and spread the Eternity Wall [base protocol](http://eternitywall.it/api)
* Citing press mentions
